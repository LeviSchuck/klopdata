Basic Usage

In order to use this static library, you need to compile first using make. You may also include the sources directly into your project and use them that way.

Information

In order to use the data class, you need to ensure that your compilation creates a data.o or data.obj, depending on your setup. Next, to use it in your code, you need to include the data.h included. The data class does NOT depend on external libraries.

Example

Using a list:

 klop::Data data;//Note: Do not use () if you plan to init with null data
 data.toList();
 data.addChild(klop::Data(42));
 printf("Forty Two is %d\n",data[0].asInt());
Using keys

 klop::Data data;//Note: Do not use () if you plan to init with null data
 data.toAssoc();
 data.addChild("F2",klop::Data(42));
 printf("Forty Two is %d\n",data["F2"].asInt());
Compounding nodes

 klop::Data data;//Note: Do not use () if you plan to init with null data
 data.toAssoc();
 klop::Data data2;
 data2.toList();
 data2.addChild(klop::Data(42));
 data2.addChild(klop::Data("Forty Two as well"));
 data.addChild("F2",data2);
 printf("Forty Two is %d\n",data["F2"][0].asInt());
 printf("Forty Two is %s\n",data["F2"][1].asString());

If you wish to compile, use make as usual. This uses no external libraries except for the tests.
The tests use cppunit. http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit/

There is a netbeans project included with all the tools such as testing and building configured.
