\hypertarget{index_usage}{}\section{Basic Usage}\label{index_usage}
In order to use this static library, you need to compile first using make. You may also include the sources directly into your project and use them that way. \hypertarget{index_basic_info}{}\subsection{Information}\label{index_basic_info}
In order to use the data class, you need to ensure that your compilation creates a data.o or data.obj, depending on your setup. Next, to use it in your code, you need to include the \hyperlink{data_8h}{data.h} included. The data class does NOT depend on external libraries.\hypertarget{index_syntax_example}{}\subsection{Example}\label{index_syntax_example}
Using a list: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
 klop::Data data;//Note: Do not use () if you plan to init with null data
 data.toList();
 data.addChild(klop::Data(42));
 printf("Forty Two is %d\n",data[0].asInt());
\end{DoxyCode}
 Using keys 
\begin{DoxyCode}
 klop::Data data;
 data.toAssoc();
 data.addChild("F2",klop::Data(42));
 printf("Forty Two is %d\n",data["F2"].asInt());
\end{DoxyCode}
 Compounding nodes 
\begin{DoxyCode}
 klop::Data data;
 data.toAssoc();
 klop::Data data2;
 data2.toList();
 data2.addChild(klop::Data(42));
 data2.addChild(klop::Data("Forty Two as well"));
 data.addChild("F2",data2);
 printf("Forty Two is %d\n",data["F2"][0].asInt());
 printf("Forty Two is %s\n",data["F2"][1].asString());
\end{DoxyCode}
